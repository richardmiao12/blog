                                <p>Corruption make the rounds on headlines in all countries once in a while, but in recent decades, it seems to really like the South American ones. Some could be quite lethal, like a drug-trafficking case by family members of <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/11/americas/venezuela-president-family-members-arrested/" style="color: #5755d9" class="tooltip tooltip-right" data-tooltip="CNN"><b>Venezuela</b></a> President Nicolás Maduro. Others could be more politically-oriented, like in <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-26220187" style="color: #5755d9" class="tooltip tooltip-right" data-tooltip="BBC"><b>Colombia</b></a>, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/brazils-president-temer-appears-set-to-avoid-a-new-corruption-trial/2017/10/25/6ae8aa24-b832-11e7-9b93-b97043e57a22_story.html?utm_term=.5a7990209970" style="color: #5755d9" class="tooltip tooltip-right" data-tooltip="Temer"><b>Brazil</b></a>, <a href="https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/11/economist-explains-14" style="color: #5755d9" class="tooltip tooltip-right" data-tooltip="Mensalão"><b>Brazil</b></a>, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/brazil-police-arrest-workers-party-treasurer-joao-vaccari-neto-1429100123" style="color: #5755d9" class="tooltip tooltip-right" data-tooltip="Neto"><b>Brazil</b></a>.</p>
                                <p>Corruption charges, or even accusations, are generally seen as detrimental to the officials in question. A misuse of of public power for private gain could be seen by many voters as a betrayal. Yet, under some circumstances, this perceived betrayal may not be the definitive end of a political career.</p>
                                <p>Take the very recent Peruvian corruption scandal which has mired President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski. For his part in a 800,000$ business-bribery case, Kuczynski will face an imminent (occurring tomorrow, in fact) vote on his impeachment.</p>
                                <p>Contrary to this seemingly hopeless situation, filled with media outcry, pessimistic analysts, and worryingly <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2017-12-14/perus-president-pedro-pablo-kuczynski-considers-pardoning-alberto-fujimori" style="color: #5755d9" class="tooltip tooltip-right" data-tooltip="Kuczynski"><b>low poll numbers</b></a>, historical and recent research shows Kuczynski to have a fighting chance--- he likely won’t be successfully impeached, and could even win re-election four years down the road.</p>

                <h2 id="name0">Do Voters Not Care About Corruption?</h2>

                                <p>They do, and they show it. Unsurprisingly, following corruption scandals like our current case, there is generally a significant <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0010414012472468" style="color: #5755d9" class="tooltip tooltip-right" data-tooltip="Zechmeister"><b>drop</b></a>
 in opinion polls. While allegations of corruption (provided they aren’t extremely incendiary) won’t necessarily increase voter turnouts, those who do turnout to vote, as they normally do, tend to give the accused official a vote decrease of 6-11%.</p>
                                <p>A drop in opinion polls, however, could be attributed by multiple factors, even when 
corruption appears to be the main cause (meaning a drop in poll immediately following an exposé), existent dissatisfaction with the regime could strengthen the drop, while previously-strong faith in the official could help damp the decrease in popularity.</p>

                <h2 id="name1">What Do Voters Care About More?</h2>

                                <p>There are different degrees of severity in which voters would care about the public good an official has done, or proceed to the other extreme when charges are particularly outrageous. As a baseline, voters tend to punish officials more than supporting them through a potential redemption process. The tendency to punish an official despite their presentable public good <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1641615" class="tooltip tooltip-right" data-tooltip="Winters"><b>holds true in Brazil</b></a>, and could likely extend to other South American countries.</p>
                                <p>For smaller regions of rule (a small city of municipality), the public good aspect of an official tend to be more well-known, and therefore weighs more against potential punishments when corruption allegations emerge. For instance, in the municipality of pastrana, a town of 1200 citizens, the mayor broke regulation and allowed the apartment buildings to be constructed on rural land. Despite the suspicious nature of this action, and the Mayor’s observed likelihood to have taken a bribe of some kind, few residents took issue. The construction of these apartment buildings generated a considerable positive impact on the local economy. Dozens of construction projects provided employment and demands for local goods. Additionally, land-owning inhabitants saw profitable increase in their land values. This is a classic <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-science-research-and-methods/article/rooting-out-corruption-or-rooting-for-corruption-the-heterogeneous-electoral-consequences-of-scandals/902FCB9C6DF2CCB1DB73E57AC07AD5D4" class="tooltip tooltip-right" data-tooltip="Vazquez"><b>example</b></a> of productivity trumping personal flaws in voters’ eyes. </p>

                                <p>On the other end of the stick is Alberto Fujimori, a former President of Peru involved in one of the most significant corruption events in the country’s history. While President, Fujimori was in fact placed under a great deal of control by his secret-police chief, Vladimiro Montesinos Torres. Montesinos accumulated years of bribery records (including written contracts and visual recordings) of influential officials within all branches of the government. Through Fujimori as a proxy, Montesino essentially ruled Peru for much of the 1990s as a puppet master. Public outrage at the President after this exposure was swift and furious. Former President Fujimori is still serving time in prison to this day. In fact, when <a href="https://cddrl.fsi.stanford.edu/publications/how_to_subvert_democracy_montesinos_in_peru" style="color: #5755d9" class="tooltip tooltip-right" data-tooltip="McMillan"><b>Keiko Fujimori</b></a>, current opposition leader and daughter of Alberto, was also accused of corruption last year, public outcry against her was perceivably harsher when compared to that of Kuczynski. </p>
