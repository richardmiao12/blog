                                <p>Corruption make the rounds on headlines in all countries once in a while, but in recent decades, it seems to really like the South American ones. Some could be quite lethal, like a drug-trafficking case by family members of <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/11/americas/venezuela-president-family-members-arrested/" style="color: #5755d9" class="tooltip tooltip-right" data-tooltip="CNN"><b>Venezuela</b></a> President Nicolás Maduro. Others could be more politically-oriented, like in <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-26220187" style="color: #5755d9" class="tooltip tooltip-right" data-tooltip="BBC"><b>Colombia</b></a>, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/brazils-president-temer-appears-set-to-avoid-a-new-corruption-trial/2017/10/25/6ae8aa24-b832-11e7-9b93-b97043e57a22_story.html?utm_term=.5a7990209970" style="color: #5755d9" class="tooltip tooltip-right" data-tooltip="Temer"><b>Brazil</b></a>, <a href="https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/11/economist-explains-14" style="color: #5755d9" class="tooltip tooltip-right" data-tooltip="Mensalão"><b>Brazil</b></a>, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/brazil-police-arrest-workers-party-treasurer-joao-vaccari-neto-1429100123" style="color: #5755d9" class="tooltip tooltip-right" data-tooltip="Neto"><b>Brazil</b></a>.</p>
                                <p>Corruption charges, or even accusations, are generally seen as detrimental to the officials in question. A misuse of of public power for private gain could be seen by many voters as a betrayal. Yet, under some circumstances, this perceived betrayal may not be the definitive end of a political career.</p>
                                <p>Take the very recent Peruvian corruption scandal which has mired President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski. For his part in a 800,000$ business-bribery case, Kuczynski will face an imminent (occurring tomorrow, in fact) vote on his impeachment.</p>
                                <p>Contrary to this seemingly hopeless situation, filled with media outcry, pessimistic analysts, and worryingly <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2017-12-14/perus-president-pedro-pablo-kuczynski-considers-pardoning-alberto-fujimori" style="color: #5755d9" class="tooltip tooltip-right" data-tooltip="Kuczynski"><b>low poll numbers</b></a>, historical and recent research shows Kuczynski to have a fighting chance--- he likely won’t be successfully impeached, and could even win re-election four years down the road.</p>

                <h2 id="name0">Do Voters Not Care About Corruption?</h2>

                                <p>They do, and they show it. Unsurprisingly, following corruption scandals like our current case, there is generally a significant <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0010414012472468" style="color: #5755d9" class="tooltip tooltip-right" data-tooltip="Zechmeister"><b>drop</b></a>
 in opinion polls. While allegations of corruption (provided they aren’t extremely incendiary) won’t necessarily increase voter turnouts, those who do turnout to vote, as they normally do, tend to give the accused official a vote decrease of 6-11%.</p>
                                <p>A drop in opinion polls, however, could be attributed by multiple factors, even when 
corruption appears to be the main cause (meaning a drop in poll immediately following an exposé), existent dissatisfaction with the regime could strengthen the drop, while previously-strong faith in the official could help damp the decrease in popularity.</p>
